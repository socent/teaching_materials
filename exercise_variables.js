// THE FORTUNE TELLER
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numKids = 2;
var partner = 'Monika';
var location = 'Toronto';
var jobTitle = 'entrepreneur';

var future = 'You will be a ' + jobTitle + ' in ' + location + ', and married to ' + 
	partner + ' with ' + numKids + ' kids.';
console.log(future);
